//Merge sort uses recursion

//pseudocode
//If only one number
//     quit
//Else
//Sort left half of numbers
//Sort right half of numbers
//Merge sorted halves

//When recursing, merge sort will keep dividing the halves until it encounters 1, then compare the two numbers
//one iteration up. It sorts by taking the two arrays and comparing the valies of both first positions,
//moving the one that is in order to a new list and filling that up with the next best numbers
//merge sort uses more memory but big O is n*log(n), worst case is also that
